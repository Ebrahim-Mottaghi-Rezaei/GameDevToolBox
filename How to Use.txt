To use this application you have to extract the *.unitypackage somewhere on your hard drive (using WinRAR for ex.)
Then you have to pass the root address for the extracted directory and set up the settings.
In some cases when you try to overwrite the files an error Pops Up.
In this case, try checking 'OverWrite Files'.

Thats it.
